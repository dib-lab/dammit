*"I love writing BLAST parsers!" -- no one, ever*

dammit is a simple de novo transcriptome annotator. It was born out of the
observation that: annotation is mundane and annoying; all the individual pieces
of the process exist already; and, the existing solutions are overly complicated 
or rely on crappy non-free software. 

Science shouldn't suck for the sake of sucking, so dammit attempts
to make this sucky part of the process suck a little less.

Installation
------------

Complete instructions with explanations and more platform options are in the documentation 
`website <http://www.camillescott.org/dammit/>`__. For the impatient, here's a stripped 
down version. These instructions assume you're on a clean Ubuntu 14.04 install.
dammit will run on OSX too, though some of the dependencies will need to be 
installed manually and are not included here.

First get packages from the Ubuntu archives::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-matplotlib python-numpy git ruby hmmer unzip \
        infernal ncbi-blast+ liburi-escape-xs-perl emboss liburi-perl \
        build-essential libsm6 libxrender1 libfontconfig1 \
        parallel
    sudo gem install crb-blast

Install some packages manually::

    cd
    curl -LO https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/archive/2.0.1.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf 2.0.1.tar.gz
    cd TransDecoder-2.0.1; make
    export PATH=$HOME/TransDecoder-2.0.1:$PATH

    cd
    curl -LO http://last.cbrc.jp/last-658.zip
    unzip last-658.zip
    cd last-658
    make
    export PATH=$HOME/last-658/src:$PATH
    export PATH=$HOME/last-658/scripts:$PATH

    cd
    curl -LO http://busco.ezlab.org/v1/files/BUSCO_v1.22.tar.gz 
    tar -xvzf BUSCO_v1.22.tar.gz
    chmod +x BUSCO_v1.22/*.py
    export PATH=$HOME/BUSCO_v1.22:$PATH
    cd

To add these to your environment permanently::

    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/TransDecoder-2.0.1' >> $HOME/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/last-658/src' >> $HOME/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH=$HOME/BUSCO_v1.22:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc

Now, install dammit::

    sudo pip install -U setuptools
    sudo pip install dammit

This will spend a bit of time compiling and installing pandas if you don't 
already have a recent versions installed; the ones available in the Ubuntu 14.04 archives are
just too old.

Dev Version
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want the latest features (and bugs), you can install dammit from github::

    pip install git+https://github.com/camillescott/dammit.git

Usage
-----

To check for dependencies, run::

    dammit dependencies

To check for databases, run::

    dammit databases

and to download and install them, run::

    dammit databases --install

To annotate your transcriptome, the most basic usage is::

    dammit annotate <transcriptome_fasta>

These are extremely basic examples; for a much more detailed description, take a look at the
relevant page in the `documentation <http://www.camillescott.org/dammit/usage.html>`__. The
documentation describes how to customization the database installation location and utilize existing
databases.

Known Issues
------------

* On some systems, installation of the ConfigParser package can get borked, which will cause
  and exception to be thrown. This can be fixed by following the directions at issue #33: https://github.com/camillescott/dammit/issues/33.
* There can be errors resuming runs which were interrupted on the BUSCO stage. If the task fails on
  resume, delete the BUSCO results folder within your dammit results folder, which will have a name
  of the form `run_<name>.busco_results`.
* The `dependencies` subcommand doesn't search for all subdependencies; for example, BUSCO relies on
  EMBOSS, which is not searched for. Although the installation instructions cover these
  dependencies, users who *cough* don't read the directions *cough* might be confused that a
  dependency is marked as installed but still doesn't work.
* dammit 0.3 does not support BUSCO v2. dammit 1.0 is building 2.0 support in.
