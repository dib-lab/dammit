title: 'dammit!'
---

dammit is a simple de novo transcriptome annotator. It was born out of
the observations that annotation is mundane and annoying, all the
individual pieces of the process exist already, and the existing
solutions are overly complicated or rely on crappy non-free software.

Science shouldn\'t suck for the sake of sucking, so dammit attempts to
make this sucky part of the process suck a little less.

dammit is free and open source, and has been built around a free and
open source ecosystem. As such, programs which the author does not
consider free enough have been eschewed as dependencies. This can either
mean programs with nonfree licenses *or* programs which are overly
difficult to install and configure \-- we believe that access is a part
of openness.
