title: Just Annotate it, dammit!
---

Once you have the dependencies installed, it's time to actually
annotate something! This guide will take you through a short example on
some test data. 


## Data

First let's download some test data. We'll start small and use a
*Schizosaccharomyces pombe* transcriptome. Make a working directory and
move there, and then download the file:

```
mkdir dammit_test
cd dammit_test
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/OLD/20170322/FASTA/cdna_nointrons_utrs.fa.gz
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/OLD/20170322/FASTA/pep.fa.gz
```

Decompress the file with gunzip:

```
gunzip cdna_nointrons_utrs.fa.gz pep.fa.gz
```

## Databases

If you're just starting, you probably haven't downloaded the databases
yet. Here we'll install the main databases, as well as the
`eukaryota` BUSCO database for our yeast dataset. This could
take a while, so consider walking away and getting yourself a cup of
coffee. If you installed dammit into a virtual environment, be sure to
activate it first:

```
dammit databases --install --busco-group eukaryota
```

Alternatively, if you happen to have downloaded many of these databases
before, you can follow the directions in the [databases
guide](database-usage.md).

While the initial download takes a while, once its done, you won't need
to do it again. `dammit` keeps track of the database state and won't
repeat work its already completed, even if you accidentally rerun with
the `--install` flag.

## Annotation

Now we'll do a simple run of the annotator. We'll use
`pep.fa` as a user database; this is a toy example, seeing
as these proteins came from the same set of transcripts as we're
annotating, but they illustrate the usage nicely enough. We'll also
specify a non-default BUSCO group. You can replace the argument to
`--n_threads` with however many cores are available on your system in
order to speed it up.:

```
dammit annotate cdna_nointrons_utrs.fa --user-databases pep.fa --busco-group eukaryota --n_threads 1
```

This will take a bit, so go get another cup of coffee...
